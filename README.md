# Interactive R Applications
I think one of the most impactful Advanced R topics is Interactive Applications and server-side R calls to incorporate R scripts into Web pages. A good jumping-on point for scientific web applications, for me was the course ["Developing Data Products" on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod). 

In this repository I have pulled to gether all my Interactive Web Projects, particularly using R, to add sophisticated scientific computations capabilities.

An overview of the options and especially use of shiny for the purpose is summarized below. Then my own relevant applications projects with links follow, begining with my first, my [Developing Data Products Project](https://github.com/medmatix/Devel_Data_Prod) which I completed for the course. This is meant to serve as my own project portfolio and I hope useful sample applications.

Simply googling "calling r from php" or serch tewrms specific to one's needs, such as this example from [Mathew Jocker's](http://www.matthewjockers.net/2008/11/11/executing-r-in-php/) blog.
